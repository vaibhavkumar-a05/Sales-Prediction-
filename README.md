Sales Prediction System using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a sales prediction system using machine learning techniques. The system utilizes historical sales data, incorporating variables such as seasonality, promotions, and economic indicators to forecast future sales accurately. Regression algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and advanced models like XGBoost or LSTM networks are implemented and optimized to achieve the best predictive performance.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:

Historical sales data
Variables: Seasonality, promotions, economic indicators
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and create additional features relevant to sales prediction.

Machine Learning Models
Various regression algorithms are explored:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
XGBoost
LSTM Networks
These models are trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict future sales.

Performance Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (R2)
These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the sales predictions.

Optimization
Hyperparameters of the models are optimized using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization to enhance prediction accuracy.

Actionable Insights
Insights derived from the models help in informing business strategies:

Identify peak sales periods
Evaluate the impact of promotions and economic factors
Forecast demand for inventory management
